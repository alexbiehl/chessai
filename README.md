I have a strong interested in typed functional programming, especially in Haskell. I am a strong proponent and enthusiast of Nix/NixOS and Rust. 

I contribute frequently to open source software, and maintain/co-maintain over 100 Haskell libraries. I am currently Chair of the Haskell Core Libraries Committee (CLC) and lead maintainer of the Haskell standard library, base.
